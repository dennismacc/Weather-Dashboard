# Weather-Dashboard
This application features an interactive weather dashboard that allows travelers to see weather forecasts for multiple cities to help them plan trips.  

## Description
The purpose of this application is to allow users to see weather forecasts for multiple cities to help them plan trips. The application was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML and CSS were for creating the webpage and its styling. JavaScript was used to dynamically create the weather dashboard and allow the user to search for a city and view its current weather as well as a 5-Day forecast. The application utilized the OpenWeather One Call API to retrieve weather data for cities through their latitude and longitude coordinates. This data was then displayed on the dashboard for the user. The application also saves the searched cities to local storage so that the user can select the city they want to see the weather for the next time the application is opened and to quickly compare the weather for multiple cities.

Working on this application I was able practice working with third-party APIs and retrieving and displaying data from them. I needed to make requests from the API that involved specific parameters so that I could display the correct information. During development I had some challenges with displaying the information that was being pulled from the API, as well working with the local storage. Future developments for the application include allowing the user to clear their search history and be able to view multiple cities at once.
