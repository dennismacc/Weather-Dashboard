# Weather-Dashboard
This application features an interactive weather dashboard that allows travelers to see weather forecasts for multiple cities to help them plan trips.  

## Description
The purpose of this application is to allow users to see weather forecasts for multiple cities to help them plan trips. The application was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. JavaScript was used to dynamically create the weather dashboard and allow the user to select a city to see the weather for. The application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for the selected city and display it on the dashboard for the user. The application also saves the user's selected city to local storage so that the user can select the city they want to see the weather for next time the application is opened and to quickly compare the weather for multiple cities.

Working on this application I was able practice working with third-party APIs and retrieving and displaying data from them. In order for the application I needed to be able to call the desired data from API 

## Usage
